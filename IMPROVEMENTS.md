# Wiki Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Engineering Wiki to enhance usability, clarity, and navigation.

## Completed Improvements

### 1. Cross-Referencing ✅
- Added "Related Documents" sections at the top of each page
- Created internal links between related workflows and standards
- Linked glossary terms to definitions
- Connected workflows to relevant tools and processes

### 2. Glossary Creation ✅
- Created comprehensive [Glossary](/overview/glossary.html) with definitions for:
  - Roles & Phases (FE, PE, DE, EA, PM, PA)
  - Job Types (WC, MT, Group Submittal, etc.)
  - File & Naming Conventions (BOM, SC, SK, MFG)
  - Epicor Terms
  - Drawing & Layout Terms
  - Material Terms
  - Tools & Systems

### 3. Enhanced Navigation ✅
- Added table of contents to longer documents:
  - FE Workflow
  - PE Workflow
  - Rhino Drafting and Layouts
- Updated index page with glossary link
- Improved document structure with clear sections

### 4. Clarified Incomplete Sections ✅
- Expanded FE to PE Release form submission details
- Added troubleshooting sections to key workflows
- Clarified Epicor part creation procedures
- Enhanced accuracy check procedures in PE workflow
- Added context to approvals process

### 5. Standardized Formatting ✅
- Consistent use of markdown formatting
- Standardized section headers
- Uniform code block formatting
- Consistent link formatting

### 6. Added Missing Context ✅
- Added "When to Use" guidance in approvals process
- Clarified prerequisites and dependencies
- Added best practices and important notes
- Enhanced step-by-step instructions with context

## Key Additions

### New Document
- **Glossary** (`overview/glossary.html`) - Centralized definitions for all engineering terms

### Enhanced Documents
- **FE Workflow** - Added troubleshooting, better cross-references, table of contents
- **PE Workflow** - Enhanced accuracy checks, troubleshooting, table of contents
- **FE to PE Release** - Expanded form submission details, better context
- **Epicor Usage** - Added troubleshooting, clarified procedures
- **All Standards** - Added cross-references and context

## Navigation Improvements

### Related Documents Sections
Each major document now includes a "Related Documents" section at the top, making it easy to navigate to:
- Related workflows
- Relevant standards
- Tool documentation
- Overview documents

### Internal Linking
- Workflows link to standards they reference
- Standards link to related workflows
- Tools link to workflows that use them
- Overview documents link to detailed workflows

## Future Enhancement Opportunities

### Potential Additions
1. **Quick Reference Guides** - One-page cheat sheets for common tasks
2. **Video Tutorials** - Links to video walkthroughs (if available)
3. **FAQ Section** - Common questions and answers
4. **Change Log** - Track updates to workflows and standards
5. **Search Functionality** - Enhanced search capabilities (Jekyll plugin)

### Areas for Further Development
1. **Design Engineering (DE) Workflow** - Currently only mentioned in overview
2. **Field Coordination Procedures** - Expand on site visits and laser scans
3. **Quality Control Checklists** - Standardized QC procedures
4. **Training Materials** - Onboarding documentation for new engineers

## Usage Tips

### For New Engineers
1. Start with [Engineering Roles](/overview/engineering-roles.html) to understand responsibilities
2. Review the [Glossary](/overview/glossary.html) for term definitions
3. Follow the [Project Delivery Overview](/overview/project-delivery.html) for workflow context
4. Reference specific workflows as needed for detailed procedures

### For Experienced Engineers
1. Use cross-references to quickly navigate between related documents
2. Check troubleshooting sections for common issues
3. Refer to standards documents when questions arise about conventions
4. Use table of contents in longer documents for quick navigation

## Maintenance Notes

- All documents use consistent front matter for Jekyll
- Links use `.html` extension for GitHub Pages compatibility
- Cross-references should be updated when documents are modified
- Glossary should be expanded as new terms are introduced
