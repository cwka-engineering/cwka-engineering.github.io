# Epicor Usage in Engineering

## I. Overview

Epicor is the central system used by the Engineering Department to manage project data, workflows, and production readiness. It integrates with tools like Rhino and Toggl to streamline operations from design to release.

## II. Core Functions of Epicor

### A. Centralized Data Management
- Stores part numbers, materials, job statuses, and time tracking.
- Ensures consistency across engineering and production workflows.

### B. Workflow Integration
- Supports BOM creation, part naming, job release.
- Ensures build strategies are reviewed and signed off.

## III. Key Dashboards & Screens

### 1. Submittal Dashboard
**Purpose**: Homepage for Fabrication Engineers (FEs).

**Features**:
- Displays submittal and post-submittal work.
- Filters jobs by engineer name.
- Tracks hours and job status.
- Handles group submittals (one doc → multiple jobs).

### 2. Production Report
**Purpose**: Update submittal statuses.

**Usage**:
- Engineers filter by name and job.
- Status options: Submitted, Revise and Resubmit, Approved.
- Final status: Production Complete.

### 3. Part
**Purpose**: Create and manage parts.

**Part Creation**:
- Search for next available part number.
- Use naming conventions (GM, Custom, WC).

**Required Fields**:
- Part Number, Description, UOM, Group, Class, Search.

**Editing Rules**:
- Part numbers are permanent.
- Descriptions editable only if not BOM'd.

### 4. Job Entry
**Purpose**: Manage and release jobs.

**Release Checklist**:
- Field Dimensions Received
- Shop Drawings Approved
- BOM Complete

**Special Jobs**:
- Engineering Bucket Jobs
- Solid Wood Component (WC) Jobs

### 5. Time & Expense Entry
**Purpose**: Enter time details.

**Process**:
- Export CSV from Toggl.
- Reformat using spreadsheet template.
- Paste into Epicor Time Entry module.

## IV. Engineering Responsibilities

### A. BOM Management
- Engineers BOM materials and hardware.
- Assign operations for material consumption.
- Use Rhino Toolkit for Autobomb and nesting optimization.

### B. Material & Hardware Ordering
- Confirm all items are ordered and received.
- Use "Purchase Direct" to notify PMs.

### C. Job Status Updates
- Ensure "Engineering Complete" is checked.
- Update submittal statuses.
- Release jobs and notify Production Engineering.

### D. Data Accuracy
- Maintain clean BOM data for drawings.
- Ensure accuracy for downstream processes.
