# PA (Project Advisor) Approvals Process

All project jobs must undergo the PA approval process before FE release to ensure build strategies are reviewed and signed off, and to identify escalation points for fabrication and assembly.

## Installing the Approvals App

Navigate to the Microsoft Teams App Store, search for "Approvals," and click "Add" to install.

## Submitting for Approval

Submit your fabrication drawing set to the assigned PA using the "Approvals" app in Microsoft Teams.

## Drawing Stamps

- Stamps are available for approving/releasing drawing packages.
- They are formatted to fit the "Production Notes" area in the upper-right corner of the new drawing template.

### Importing Stamps
- Release stamps are located at a LINK. Use Box Sync to sync this folder.
- In Bluebeam, go to "Tools," hover over "Stamp," select "Change Stamp Folder," and choose the synced Box folder.

### Placing a Stamp
- Once the folder is redirected, click the desired stamp, and you'll be prompted to place it.
- Select near the "Production Notes" area.
- Turn on Bluebeam grid snaps for proper alignment.

## Approvals App Process

### Objective
To ensure consistent and accurate submission of job submittals for internal review and approval using the Approvals App.

### Step 1: Initiate a New Approval Request
1. Open the Approvals App.
2. Click the "New Approval Request" button in the upper right-hand corner.
3. Select the "Basic Request" option.

### Step 2: Name the Request
- Use the standard naming format:
  - `PROJ.JOB_ScopeDescription`

### Step 3: Configure Approvers
1. Toggle "Require responses in the assigned order" to ON.
2. Add approvers in the following order:
   - Project Manager (PM) – e.g., Jacob, Sadarah, Lucia, Irmak
   - Project Advisor (PA) – e.g., Trevor, Dustin, Bill
3. Only use @digifabshop.com email addresses relevant to the approval.

### Step 4: Set Priority
- Choose the priority level based on the urgency of the job submittal.

### Step 5: Add Additional Details
In the Additional Details field, include:
- Comments
- Fabrication notes
- Highlights or special instructions

### Step 6: Attach Review File
1. Click "Add Attachment" and select "Attach Link":
   - Display Name: `PROJ.JOB_ScopeDescription`
   - Address: Link to the BOX.com file located at
     - `00_Internal_Review > PROJ.JOB_ScopeDescription.pdf`
2. Confirm by clicking the checkmark.

### Step 7: Submit the Request
- Click the "Send" button.

## Post-Submission Workflow

### Review Process
- The request appears in your "Sent" approvals list.
- The PM:
  - Reviews and comments using Bluebeam (not BOX.com).
  - Approves or denies the request.
- Once PM completes their review, the PA is prompted to do the same.
- If the PA is unavailable, the PM will follow up.

### If Denied
- The Fabrication Engineer (FE):
  - Reviews all comments.
  - Submits a new request following the same steps.

### Finalization After Approval
- The PM:
  - Generates a clean, comment-free PDF of the reviewed file.
  - Places it in the "01_Outgoing" folder.
  - This version becomes the official client submittal.

## Important Notes

- Always keep current versions in their designated folders.
- Avoid moving or renaming files in Windows Explorer to preserve BOX links.
- Clean up the Internal Review and Outgoing folders after approval. (The current version remains).
- Archive or delete marked-up versions of drawings.
