# Engineering Glossary

## Roles & Phases

- **DE (Design Engineering)**: Phase that converts approximate geometries to precise geometries, develops build strategies and assembly details
- **FE (Fabrication Engineer)**: Engineer responsible for developing design engineering geometries into fabrication-ready geometries and creating shop drawings
- **PE (Production Engineer)**: Engineer responsible for toolpaths, reference geometries, and production programming
- **EA (Engineering Assistant)**: Support role managing Epicor materials database and job creation
- **PM (Project Manager)**: Manages project coordination and client communication
- **PA (Project Advisor)**: Reviews and approves build strategies before FE release

## Job Types

- **Engineering Jobs**: Jobs that start with "E" and match 1:1 with production jobs
- **Bucket Jobs**: Project-wide tasks like design, coordination, meetings, BIM (e.g., PROJ.ENG)
- **WC Jobs**: Wood Component manufacturing jobs
- **MT Jobs**: Metal Component or Kit of Parts manufacturing jobs
- **Group Submittal**: A package of multiple jobs submitted together to the client
- **Primary Job**: Subset of the project or group submittal

## File & Naming Conventions

- **BOM (Bill of Materials)**: List of materials and hardware required for a job
- **SC (Shipping Component)**: Logical grouping of parts for shipping (e.g., SC005)
- **SK**: Sketch or cut sheet for CNC machines
- **MFG**: Manufactured parts from feeder jobs
- **WC**: Wood Component
- **MT**: Metal Component
- **IP**: Kit of Parts

## Epicor Terms

- **Submittal Dashboard**: Homepage for FEs showing submittal and post-submittal work
- **Production Report**: Screen for updating submittal statuses
- **Job Entry**: Screen for managing and releasing jobs
- **UD40**: Shipping Components - Kinetic workbench

## Drawing & Layout Terms

- **T00**: Title Sheet
- **G00**: General Requirements and Schedules
- **1XX**: Reference Plans
- **2XX**: Shop Drawings
- **3XX**: Install & Shipping Drawings
- **4XX**: Fabrication Supplements
- **SKXX**: Sketches (not for submission)

## Material Terms

- **Lay-up**: Pre-laminated material assembly
- **Edgebanding (EB)**: Material applied to exposed edges
- **Scribe**: Oversized dimension for field fitting
- **VIF (Verify in Field)**: Dimensions to be verified on-site

## Tools & Systems

- **Engineering Toolkit**: Grasshopper-based toolkit for Rhino integration with Epicor
- **Toggl**: Time tracking application used for time entry
- **Bluebeam**: PDF editing and markup software
- **Rhino**: 3D modeling software
- **Grasshopper**: Visual programming environment for Rhino
