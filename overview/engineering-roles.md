# Overview of Engineering Roles & Core Competencies

The Engineering department is responsible for transforming concepts into products by clearly communicating complex information. Engineers analyze data from various sources (drawings, models, specifications) and synthesize it into actionable information.

## Fabrication Engineer (FE)

Focuses on developing design engineering (DE) geometries into fabrication-ready geometries.

- The end goal is models that are manageable in programming and can be assembled after fabrication.
- Responsible for creating shop drawings, which describe material, hardware, size, build strategy, and necessary shipping components.
- Ensures all material, hardware, and work by outside vendors are ordered and received before approval.
- Picks up redlines from approved drawing sets and reflects changes in shop drawings.
- Creates a clean, separate PE file for handoff.
- Creates the shipping component list.
- Responsible for the top three checks in Epicor before releasing a job: Field Dimensions Received, Shop Drawings Approved, and BOM Complete.

## Production Engineer (PE)

Handles all program-related toolpaths, reference geometries, and additional information needed to fabricate a job.

- Assembles the final release package.
- Produces a Master Parts List and Lay-up Summary.
- Copies the PE Rhino file from FE and makes it the working Rhino file for production.
- Creates a fully cleaned-up '_SHOP' Rhino model if needed for the shop floor.
- Places completed shop drawings from FE into the Production_Drawings folder.
- Places all SK's related to production release, including cut sheets for CNC machines.

## General Engineer Competencies

### Production Deliverables
Create high-fidelity 3D/parametric modeling and drafting deliverables. Improve information transfer to clients and shop.

### Field Coordination
Gather field dimensions, conduct laser scans, perform site visits, document conditions, generate reports, and coordinate with Project Managers (PMs), Construction Managers, and Installers.

### Process Management
Work with PMs to meet project and production goals, reimagine workflows, own processes and products, and proactively provide solutions.

### Time Management
Develop reliable deliverable schedules, make timely decisions, track hours/progress against budget, and escalate significant challenges.

### Accountability
Clearly state actions and their purpose, proactively identify problems, effectively communicate solutions, deliver results positively, and collaborate with peers.

## Engineering Assistant (EA)

- Manage Epicor materials database, ensuring standardization of entries and timely response to new part requests.
- Create Jobs in coordination with PM and Engineers, updating sales orders and producing Epicor entries, including primary jobs, sample jobs, mockups, and manufacturing jobs.
- Update job scheduling due to ship date changes using scheduling workbenches in Epicor.
- Monitor data health, troubleshoot part entries, and gain familiarity with all of Epicor's function and utility.
