# Creating Details

> **Related**: [Layout Structure](/standards/rhino-drafting/layout-structure.html) | [Sections & Clipping](/standards/rhino-drafting/sections-clipping.html)

## Creating Detail Views

1. Use the **Detail** command and select "add" to create new detailed views on a layout. [^transcript-layouts]
2. **Name the detail view** (e.g., "front view"). The name field ties in with the detail title block.
3. Use **Hide in Detail** to selectively hide objects within a specific detail view.
4. You can also hide objects by turning their respective **Detail Layer** in the layers panel.
   - **Note**: This is the secondary light bulb per layer that can be toggle on a per detail basis.
5. **Lock your detailed view** once finalized to prevent:
   - Accidental shifting
   - Disconnected dimensions and leaders

## Setting Views

[^transcript-layouts] Use the dropdown filter "Set View" to choose isometric, plan, elevation, or other view types that best capture your scope.

## Labeling Details

- Use the "Legends and Symbols" block, specifically the **Detail Title** block.
- Connect block attributes to:
  - Detail view's name
  - Detail view's scale
- Use text fields: object name, object scale
- Ensure the detail title is on the "Detail Title" layer
