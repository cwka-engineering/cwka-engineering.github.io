# Modeling Toolkit

> **Related**: [Drafting Toolkit](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/toolkit/drafting.html) | [Takeoffs](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/takeoffs.html)

## Parts List Tab

### L00 - Master Parts List
- **Purpose**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] Standardized format for parts schedules within drawing sets. This is a targeted parts list (e.g., for metal shop) - not the comprehensive master parts list Excel that PE creates. Use when you need a parts schedule in the drawing set in addition to Excel.

### L001 - Pick List
- **Purpose**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] Backend model space page for BOM information while working on scope. Not typically printed for external audience - primarily for FE engineer's use during design. Facilitates takeoffs and BOM tracking.

### Analysis Functionality
- **Display**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] Parts list tab reads out all attributes calculated during naming step and displays them on the page.
- **Manufactured Part Mode**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] For manufactured parts (MT/WC), use Manufactured Part mode during naming to get additional analysis:
  - Cuts on left/right ends
  - Shape analysis
  - Diagrammatic view of length relative to other parts

### Export Options
- **Excel Export**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] Can export master parts list directly to Excel (exports to same folder as Rhino file). PE can also use this feature to output master parts list Excel instead of printing on page.

## Next Steps

- Proceed to [Takeoffs](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/takeoffs.html) for BOM generation workflow.
