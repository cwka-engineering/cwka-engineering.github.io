> **Related**: [Takeoffs](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/takeoffs.html) | [FE to PE Release SOP](/workflows/fe-to-pe-release.html)

## Material Checks

- Confirm all materials, hardware, and vendor work are ordered and received.

## Picking Up Redlines

- Apply architect redlines to shop drawings.
- Final set becomes "For Record" sent back to architect.

## Finalizing Shop Drawings

- Ensure completeness: materials, hardware, sizes, build strategy, SCs.
- Follow [Rhino Drafting and Layouts](/standards/rhino-drafting/) standards.
- Submit for approval using the [Approvals Process](/tools/approvals-process.html).

## Creating PE File

- Clean version: no clutter, blocks, unused layers.

## Released in Epicor

- Confirm job release before notifying team.

## Notify PE Team

- Post release in CO Production Eng chat.
- Include links to all relevant files.

## Next Steps

- See [FE to PE Release SOP](/workflows/fe-to-pe-release.html) for complete release procedure
- Or check [Troubleshooting](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/troubleshooting.html) if you encounter issues
