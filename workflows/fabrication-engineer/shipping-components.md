# Shipping Components (SCs)

> **Related**: [Part Naming](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/part-naming.html) | [PE Release Preparation](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/pe-release-prep.html)

## SC List

- Use Excel template from:
  - `CWKA Team Folders > Engineering Team > PRODUCTION ENGINEERING > PE to Floor SOP > Shipping Components_Template`
- For detailed SC creation process, see [FE to PE Release - File Organization](/workflows/fe-to-pe-release.html#2-file-organization--folder-setup).

## Modeling Toolkit

- **Enter SC Descriptions**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] After naming parts, toolkit identifies shipping components. You must provide descriptions for each SC (e.g., "spacer", "base carcass", "seat cushion", "back cushion"). Publish changes to document, then export shipping component list directly for PE release.
- **Future Enhancement**: [^transcript-adv-toolkit] Work in progress to add button that directly publishes to UD40IN Epicor, eliminating need for PE to manually enter SC data.
- Export list for PE release.

## Next Steps

- Continue to [Takeoffs](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/takeoffs.html) for BOM generation
- Or jump to [PE Release Preparation](/workflows/fabrication-engineer/pe-release-prep.html) when ready to release
